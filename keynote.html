  <p class="body">A.P.S. Selvadurai is <i>William Scott</i> Professor and <i>James McGill Professor</i> in the Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics, McGill University, Montréal, Canada. He obtained his PhD and DSc degrees in Theoretical Mechanics from the University of Nottingham. Since 1993, he has been a faculty member at McGill University (<a class="body-link" href="https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/selvadurai" target="_blank">https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/selvadurai</a>). He has held Visiting Professorships at the Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France; University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand; The Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China; The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, The Technical University of Delft and the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. He has received the <i>Humboldt Senior Scientist Award</i>, the Inaugural <i>John Booker Medal</i> of IACMAG, the <i>Max Planck Research Prize</i> in the Engineering Sciences, <i>The Killam Prize for Engineering, CANCAM Gold Medal, IACMAG Medal</i> for Outstanding Accomplishments in Theoretical, Computational and Experimental Geomechanics and in 2010 he received the <i>ALERT</i> Medal awarded by Alliance of Laboratories in Europe for Research and Technology. In 2012, he was awarded the degree of <i>Docteur Honoris Causa</i> by the Institut Polytechnique de Grenoble, France. In 2013, he was awarded <i>The Eric Reissner Medal</i> of the International Conference on Computational and Experimental Engineering and Sciences and <i>The Maurice A. Biot Medal</i> of the American Society of Civil Engineers for seminal contributions to continuum geomechanics, applied mechanics and mathematical modelling. </p>

  <p class="body">He has published extensively in archival journals (<a class="body-link" href="https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/selvadurai/list-research-publications" target="_blank">https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/selvadurai/list-research-publications</a>) devoted to applied mechanics, geomechanics, applied mathematics, computational mechanics and experimental mechanics. His books include <i>Elasticity and Geomechanics</i> (with R.O. Davis) (Cambridge University Press, 1996), <i>Partial Differential Equations</i> in Mechanics Vols. 1&2 (Springer-Verlag, 2000); <i>Plasticity and Geomechanics</i> (with R.O. Davis) (Cambridge University Press, 2002), <i>Transport in Porous Media</i> (with Y. Ichikawa) (Springer-Verlag, 2012) and <i>Thermo-poroelasticity and Geomechanics</i> (with A.P. Suvorov) Cambridge University Press, 2016). He serves on the Editorial Boards of twelve leading International Journals devoted to <i>Geomechanics, Applied Mechanics, Computational Mechanics and Engineering Mathematics</i>. He is a Fellow of the following Academies and Learned Societies: <i>The Royal Society of Canada, The Canadian Academy of Engineering, The Engineering Institute of Canada, The American Academy of Mechanics, The Canadian Society for Civil Engineering and The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications and its Applications (UK)</i>.</p>
