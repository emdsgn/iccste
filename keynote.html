  <p class="body">Giovanni Grasselli is Professor and NSERC/Energi Simulation Research Chair in Fundamental Rock Physics and Rock Mechanics at the University of Toronto. His research focuses on hybrid finite-discrete element (FDEM) numerical technology, experimental geomechanics applied to the study of tunneling and hydraulic fracturing. He received the prestigious ISRM Rocha Medal (2004) for best thesis worldwide in rock mechanics and supervised two Rocha Medal winner (2015 and 2017). Through the start-up company Geomechanica Inc., the FDEM technology is currently commercialized and translated to engineering practice.</p>

  <p class="body">Dr. Magdi Mohareb is a professor of structural engineering at the University of Ottawa. His research interests involve buckling problems in structural steel and pipelines. A significant part of his work over the past 20 years centred on developing innovative analysis, design, and strengthening solutions for lateral torsional buckling problems in structural steel, timber, and composites. </p>
  <p class="body">Dr. Mohareb received a Bachelor in Civil Engineering from Cairo University, Egypt in (1986), a MASc in Structural Engineering from Texas Tech University (1990) and a PhD from the University of Alberta in (1995). He is registered as a professional engineer in Alberta and Ontario. Before joining academia in 2000, he worked for several years as a structural engineer and was involved in designing and upgrading industrial structures.</p>
  <p class="body">Over his academic career, Dr. Mohareb co-authored over a 100 refereed publications, and graduated 19 Master students and nine PhD students, four of whom are presently holding academic positions in Canada and abroad. He served as peer reviewer for over 30 journals and is presently on the Editorial board of three peer reviewed journals. He is the recipient of the Outstanding Associate Editor Award by Canadian Science Publishing (2017) for his service to the Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, and is the recipient of the John V. Marsh Teaching Award (2018) from the University of Ottawa.</p>
