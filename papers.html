    <p class="body">Manuscripts are invited for the International Conference on Control, Dynamic Systems, and Robotics (CDSR) on topics lying within the scope of the conference. All contributions must be original and should not have been published elsewhere.</p>

    <p class="body"><i>Three types of manuscripts</i> could be published in the conference proceedings:</p>

    <ul>
	<li>Extended Abstracts</li>
	<li>Short Papers</li>
	<li>Full Papers</li>
	</ul>

    <p class="body">You may choose to submit any of the above based on the the weight of the contributions in your manuscript.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><b>Extended abstracts</b> are welcome for publication. These submissions should be around 500 words and must give a clear indication of the objectives, scope, and results (if available) of the research. No figures or tables are allowed. Presentation for these submissions are limited to 10 minutes (if oral) or poster.</li>

    <li><b>Short papers</b> must give a clear indication of the objectives, scope, and results of the paper, and must (at least) contain an abstract, an introduction, a results/discussion section, and a reference section. Short papers are limited to 4 pages. Presentation for these submissions are limited to 20 minutes (if oral) or poster.</li>

    <li><b>Full Papers</b> are limited to 8 pages and are more descriptive of the work that has been done. Also, more sections, images, graphs, and results could be presented. Presentation for these submissions are limited to 20 minutes (if oral) or poster.</li>
	</ul>

    <p class="body">Please note that a .docx template is available to guide the authors in formatting their papers. All papers (including extended abstracts) <b>must</b> comply with the template.</p>
